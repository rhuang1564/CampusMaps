# adding nodes in reverse order and adding edges 
# in non-alphabetical order to test if it prints 
# out in alphabetical order

# Create a graph
created graph A

# Add two nodes in reverse order
added node b to A
added node a to A

# Add five edges in non-alphabetical order
added edge AB2 from a to b in A
added edge BB from b to b in A
added edge AB1 from a to b in A
added edge BA from b to a in A
added edge AA from a to a in A
added edge AB3 from a to b in A

# Print the nodes in the graph, the outgoing edges from a, 
# and outgoing edges from b
A contains: a b
the children of a in A are: a(AA) b(AB1) b(AB2) b(AB3)
the children of b in A are: a(BA) b(BB)
