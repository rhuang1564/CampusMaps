# Tests adding a multiple edges between same node

# Create a graph
created graph A

# Add a node
added node node1 to A
added node node2 to A

# Add edges
added edge edge1 from node1 to node2 in A
added edge edge2 from node1 to node2 in A
added edge edge3 from node1 to node2 in A
added edge edge4 from node1 to node2 in A
added edge edge1 from node2 to node1 in A
added edge edge2 from node2 to node1 in A
added edge edge3 from node2 to node1 in A
added edge edge4 from node2 to node1 in A
added edge edge5 from node2 to node1 in A

# Print the nodes in the graph and checks its edges
A contains: node1 node2
the children of node1 in A are: node2(edge1) node2(edge2) node2(edge3) node2(edge4)
the children of node2 in A are: node1(edge1) node1(edge2) node1(edge3) node1(edge4) node1(edge5)
