# Tests alphabetical ordering of listening of a node with multiple edges between same node

# Create a graph
created graph A

# Add a node
added node node1 to A
added node node2 to A

# Add edges
added edge edgeB from node1 to node2 in A
added edge edgeA from node1 to node2 in A
added edge edgeD from node1 to node2 in A
added edge edgeC from node1 to node2 in A
added edge edgeF from node2 to node1 in A
added edge edgeG from node2 to node1 in A
added edge edgeA from node2 to node1 in A
added edge edgeB from node2 to node1 in A
added edge edgeZ from node2 to node1 in A

# Print the nodes in the graph and checks its edges
A contains: node1 node2
the children of node1 in A are: node2(edgeA) node2(edgeB) node2(edgeC) node2(edgeD)
the children of node2 in A are: node1(edgeA) node1(edgeB) node1(edgeF) node1(edgeG) node1(edgeZ)
