# Tests adding a single node to the graph with a self edge

# Create a graph
created graph A

# Add a node
added node node1 to A

# Add an edge
added edge edge1 from node1 to node1 in A

# Print the nodes in the graph and checks its edges
A contains: node1
the children of node1 in A are: node1(edge1)
