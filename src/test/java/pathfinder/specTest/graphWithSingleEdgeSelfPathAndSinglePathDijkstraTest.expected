# Find a path between node and another node
# and node to itself with Dijkstra's algorithm
# in a single edged graph

created graph graph

added node A to graph
added node B to graph

added edge 1.000 from A to B in graph

path from A to B:
A to B with weight 1.000
total cost: 1.000

path from A to A:
total cost: 0.000
