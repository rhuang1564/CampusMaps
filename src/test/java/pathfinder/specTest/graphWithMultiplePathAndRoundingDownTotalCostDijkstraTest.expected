# Find a path with Dijkstra's algorithm
# in the graph with multiple paths and
# tests rounding down for adding weight of path

created graph graph

added node A to graph
added node B to graph
added node C to graph
added node D to graph

added edge 1.000 from A to B in graph
added edge 1.000 from A to C in graph
added edge 1.000 from C to D in graph
added edge 1.000 from B to D in graph

path from A to D:
A to B with weight 1.000
B to D with weight 1.000
total cost: 2.000
